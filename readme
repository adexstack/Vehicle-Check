I have made this project compatible with cucumber BDD, testng and maven frameworks to run as suitable
To run as cucumber test, open DLG_Project/src/test/java/cucumberOptions/TestRunner.java read comment; run as JUnit Test
To run as Testng test, right click on eclipse-workspace/DLG_Project/testng.xml and run as TESTNG SUITE
To run as maven test(For CI/CD capability); right click on eclipse-workspace/DLG_Project/pom.xml and run as Maven test

I have implemented logging using log4j and logs can be found in DLG_Project/logs
Also, screenshots on failure is implemented 
For Automation Test Result Report; using ExtentReportNG and to see the html reports for test:
  For testng run; test-output->ExtentReportsTestNG.html (Right click->Properties and copy the path)
  for maven run; target->surefire-reports->ExtentReportsTestNG.html

All dependencies are implemented in pom.xml file

Please refresh project after run completed to see current logs, reports and screenshots

I have made this project compatible with cucumber BDD, testng and maven frameworks to run as required
To run as cucumber test, open <Project>/src/test/java/cucumberOptions/TestRunner.java read comment; run as JUnit Test
To run as Testng test, right click on <Project>/testng.xml and run as TESTNG SUITE
To run as maven test(For CI/CD capability); right click on <Project>/pom.xml and run as Maven test

I have implemented logging using log4j and logs can be found in <Project>/logs
Also, screenshots on failure is implemented 
For Automation Test Result Report; using ExtentReportNG and to see the html reports for test:
  For testng run; test-output->ExtentReportsTestNG.html (Right click->Properties and copy the path)
  for maven run; target->surefire-reports->ExtentReportsTestNG.html

All dependencies are implemented in pom.xml file

Please refresh project after run completed to see current logs, reports and screenshots
